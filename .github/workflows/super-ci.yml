I want you to write a C# (or Python, or PowerShell—your choice!) automation script/tool that:

Recursively scans all files and folders on all connected drives.
Searches for key information, configuration, code, credentials, and project data that might be needed for any ongoing or future automation, scripting, or documentation.
Builds and maintains a live, persistent index or database (like info_index.json or SQLite) mapping every relevant keyword, config, or hint to its exact file and line/section.
Never deletes files; instead, repurposes, organizes, and tags them for later use or reference.
Automatically refreshes and restarts itself if there is an error, stall, or crash, so the process never stops (like a river).
Updates a live dashboard (webpage or console UI) so I can see progress, system heartbeat, and new discoveries in real time.
Handles errors by logging and quarantining them for later review, never stopping the main flow.
Saves the locations of all key information it finds to the index/database for quick lookup by Copilot, me, or any automation.
Repeats the discovery/indexing/consolidation process forever, or until I manually stop it.
You may use advanced file watchers, multi-threading, or async/await to keep the system quick and responsive.
If any configuration or information is missing from the automation, you must search the system for it before ever asking me for manual input.
Show me the main script, and describe any supporting files or settings I should add to my project to make it run as a “Go Live” always-on service.

Bonus: If possible, launch a minimal local web server (like ASP.NET, Flask, or Kestrel) to serve the dashboard live at http://localhost:7270/ just like when I hit F5 in Visual Studio.
